Adding a new checker to the cve-bin-tool
========================================

In order to add a new checker to the CVE-bin-tool, one must provide a checker
file.  See any checker in the `checkers/` directory as an example.

Currently, this checker must provide one function:

`get_version(lines, filename)`

The CVE-bin-checker works by extracting strings from binaries and determining
if a given library has been compiled into the binary.  This function takes as
input the extracted string lines and the filename and returns information about
whether the binary contains the library in question, is a copy of the library
in question, and if either of those are true it also returns a version string.
If the binary does not contain the library, this function returns an empty dict
structure.

The if the CLI for `curl` was scanned the output dict would look something like
this.

```json
{
  "is_or_contains": "is",
  "modulename": "curl",
  "version": "6.41.0"
}
```

The docstring of the function must contain the vendor and package name pair(s)
as they appear in NVD. The best way to do this is to search the cached sqlite
version of the NVD using a CVE you want to know the vendor package pair(s) for.

```console
$ sqlite3 ~/.cache/cve-bin-tool/nvd.vulnerabilities.db \
    "SELECT Vendor_Name, Product_Name FROM nvd_data WHERE CVE_Number='CVE-2016-0718';" \
    | sed -e 's/|/, /g' -e 's/^/VPkg\: /'
VPkg: apple, mac_os_x
VPkg: canonical, ubuntu_linux
VPkg: debian, debian_linux
VPkg: libexpat, expat
VPkg: mozilla, firefox
VPkg: opensuse, leap
VPkg: suse, linux_enterprise_debuginfo
```

The resulting docstring in `get_version` would have those `VPkg` listings at the
end of it. Some of the listings will be with regards to packages that include
this package. For our example all listings except `libexpat, expat` mearly
include the target package (`expat` for the example SQL query).

```python
def get_version(lines, filename):
    '''
    Description...

    VPkg: libexpat, expat
    '''
```

Once the checker is added, its name should also be added to __init__.py (so
that `from modules import *` will find it).
